# Project Documentation/Report Outline
## Suggested format for documenting or reporting a software engineering project

#### This template can be used as a resource for documenting or reporting a specific SWE or other technical project.  It includes the important focus sections, with a short description for each one.

#### Some things to note:
   - These sections are guidelines only, so feel free to combine them if you think the scope of your project aligns with that
   - Diagrams or visuals are always effective additions to any report or documentation
   - If you make a reference to some resource, having a link to that resource is always recommended
   - However you use this, *remember to remove any unnecessary explanation text that was part of the original template*
